Exercise: Detecting Biases and Ethical Considerations in Data Analysis
Objective: Students will explore the Adult Census Income dataset to identify potential biases and ethical implications based on non-sensitive features such as sex, education, and occupation, and assess how these could impact decision-making.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income 

Step 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Task: Load the dataset and familiarize yourself with its structure.


Identify key features such as age, workclass, sex, education, income, etc.
Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
Questions:


What features might be considered sensitive (e.g., sex, education)?
Are there any missing or inconsistent values in the dataset? How might these affect analysis?

Step 2: Visualize Distributions
Task: Plot the distributions of the following features:


Sex
Education levels
Income (<=50K vs. >50K)
Questions:


Do certain groups dominate the dataset? For example, is one sex overrepresented?
What does the distribution of income look like across these groups?



Step 3: Analyze Income Distribution by Group
Task: Calculate the percentage of individuals earning >50K across:


Sex groups
Education levels
Occupation
Questions:


Are there significant disparities in income distribution among these groups?
Which groups are more likely to earn >50K, and which are less likely?

Step 4: Explore Relationships Between Features
Task: Analyze how combinations of features (e.g., sex and education, sex and occupation) relate to income.


Create pivot tables or grouped bar charts showing the income breakdown for:
Sex by education level
Education by occupation
Questions:


Are there any surprising patterns? For example, do certain education levels result in different income levels based on sex?
How might these patterns reflect potential biases ?

Step 5: Critical Thinking and Ethics
Task: Reflect on the findings.


Identify any potential sources of bias in the dataset (e.g., gender inequality in certain occupations or educational outcomes).
Discuss how these biases could impact decision-making processes if used in real-world applications - Please try to imagine different real world situations and describe how these biases can have an impact.
Questions:


Why is it important to identify biases in data before making decisions based on it?
What steps could you take to ensure fair and ethical use of this dataset?

Deliverables
Report: Write a short summary (1â€“2 pages) of your findings, including:


Key disparities observed in the dataset.
Potential ethical concerns related to these disparities.
Recommendations for addressing the biases found.
Visualizations: Include charts and tables used in your analysis.



Example Discussion Points
Gender Bias: If a particular sex is underrepresented or concentrated in certain occupations, the results might unfairly reflect this bias in decision-making.
Education and Occupation: Disparities in education levels or job opportunities across different demographic groups might impact income inequality.
Ethical Use: If this data were used to allocate resources or opportunities (e.g., for loans, hiring), what steps could be taken to ensure fairness for all groups?
